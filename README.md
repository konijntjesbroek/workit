### Overview

I have been dissatisfied with most of the task list applications I have used
over the years. They often require too much interaction as the day goes on or
don't allow for me to track the data I want. So I am setting out to write the
one that I do want. To start out, this will be text based, If, as I use it, I 
see a need to toss in graphics for ease of analysis, that will happen 
organically.
